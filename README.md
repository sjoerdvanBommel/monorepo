# Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

**My monorepo for fast, efficient and bundled project management** ðŸš€

Welcome to my monorepo! This README guide will walk you through the steps to get the project up and running. Before you begin, make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) v20+ installed on your system.

### Current packages

**General**
- `@mr/config` for ESLint configuration
- `@mr/tsconfig` for all tsconfig files to keep things consistent over different projects
- `@mr/pg-admin` to spin up a PgAdmin docker container. Make sure to read it's [README](./packages/pg-admin/README.md) if you're going to use it.

**SwipeScript**
- `@mr-ss/database` which contains all database logic for SwipeScript
- `@mr-ss/web` which contains the front-end Next.js project for SwipeScript

> [!NOTE]
> `mr` stands for MonoRepo<br>
> `ss` stands for SwipeScript

## Getting Started

### **1. Clone the Repository** 

```
git clone https://github.com/sjoerdvanbommel/monorepo.git
cd monorepo
```

### **2. Install Dependencies** 

Using npm or yarn? This project uses pnpm workspaces, so make sure to install pnpm globally first:

```
npm i -g pnpm
# OR
yarn global add pnpm
```

Once pnpm is installed, run:

```
pnpm i
```


### **3. Initialize Project Settings**

```
pnpm run setup
```

The setup script will first copy over all `.env.example` files to `.env` files in the same directory. Next, it will synchronously run the following scripts in all repos:

- `docker-compose` to make sure all docker containers are running
- `db:generate` to generate the database clients
- `db:migrate:dev` to run existing migrations (`db:push` can be used later to prototype schema changes)
- `db:seed` to fill the database with example data

**You only have to execute this on initial installation!**

> [!NOTE]
> If you run into compile errors in VS Code after this step, you might need to restart the TypeScript server:
> 
> Open a TypeScript file and run `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P` -> `TypeScript: Restart TS Server`

> [!NOTE]
> Turborepo has a [different approach](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/handbook/dev#using-environment-variables) of using environment variables in a monorepo, which increases coupling of the monorepo. They are currently working on a first-class solution, but until then the `.env.example` files will be copied over with a custom script.

### **4. Start the Development Server**

```
pnpm run dev
```

This command will launch the development server for all projects inside of this monorepo, allowing you to start developing a project immediately. Once this monorepo becomes bigger, this command will be split up in separate commands to prevent.

### **Lint Codebase**

```
pnpm run lint
```
Check your code for potential issues and maintain a consistent coding style using ESLint.
