# JavaScript Introduction

In modern times, basically all websites contain some sort of interactivity. This is barely possible using only HTML and CSS. JavaScript is the most used programming language for adding interactivity to a website.

**Trying it out is super easy.** You can:

- Open a [JavaScript sandbox](https://codepen.io/pen/)
- Open the Dev Tools in your browser (F12 in Google Chrome) ![](https://mr-ss-bucket-staging.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/devtools.png)
- <span>Add the following code to your HTML head:</span>

```html
<script src="scripts/main.js"></script>
```
