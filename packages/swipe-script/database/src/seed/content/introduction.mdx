In modern times, basically all websites contain some sort of interactivity. This is barely possible using only HTML and CSS. JavaScript is the most used programming language for adding interactivity to a website.

<br />

<div class="flex gap-4">
  <p>One of the simplest examples of using JavaScript is a counter button ðŸ‘‰</p>

  <div class="flex-shrink-0">
    <CounterButton />
  </div>
</div>

<br />

Trying out JavaScript yourself is really easy. Some options:

- Open a JavaScript sandbox like [Codepen.io](https://codepen.io/pen/)
- Open the Dev Tools in your browser (F12 in Google Chrome)
- Add the following script tag to your HTML head:

<div class="h-2" />

```html
<script src="./index.js"></script>
```

<br />

Or follow along in this course of course ðŸ˜‰
