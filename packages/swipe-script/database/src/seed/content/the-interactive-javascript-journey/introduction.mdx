Let's start with an easy one for some free points ðŸ‘‡

<InlineQuestion id={10000001} />

In modern times, basically all websites contain some sort of interactivity. Just like this one!
This isn't possible using only HTML and CSS.
JavaScript is by far the most used programming language for adding interactivity to a website.

<br />

<div class="flex gap-4">
  <p>One of the simplest examples of using JavaScript is a counter button ðŸ‘‰</p>

  <div class="flex-shrink-0">
    <CounterButton />
  </div>
</div>

<br />

Trying out JavaScript yourself is really easy. Some options are:

- Open a JavaScript sandbox like [Codepen.io](https://codepen.io/pen/)
- Open the Dev Tools in your browser (F12 in Google Chrome)
- Add the following script tag to your HTML head:

<div class="h-2" />

```html
<script src="./index.js"></script>
```

<br />

**Or:** follow along in this course of course ðŸ˜‰ There will be plenty of opportunities for you to code here using a mobile-friendly tool!
